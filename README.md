# DiscordBot

Meant as a way to dive deeper into JS, while also using it to create something useful for my friends.

# Functionality
The main goal of this bot is to create a quick way to receive Tarkov item info by using the [Tarkov Dev API](https://tarkov.dev/). 

#Progress
Aside from creating basic Discord commands and interactions, I can receive GraphQL entries from the tarkov API and parse these to output what the user needs. 

Next step is to create more search terms to parse the database easily, and to make searching for items easier (such as Ammo damage and price).
